# Zomato Dataset Analysis with Python

Welcome to the Zomato Dataset Analysis repository, where I've conducted a comprehensive exploration of Zomato's restaurant data using Python. This project involves data preprocessing, machine learning through train-test splitting, and insightful visualizations to uncover patterns and trends in the dataset.

## Features:

- **Train-Test Splitting:** Employed machine learning techniques by dividing the dataset into training and testing sets, ensuring robust model evaluation and performance.

- **Data Visualization:** Created visually appealing and informative plots to illustrate key insights from the Zomato dataset. Explore trends, preferences, and correlations through interactive visualizations.

- **Insightful Analysis:** Delved into the dataset to extract meaningful information such as popular cuisines, restaurant ratings, and user preferences. Uncover hidden patterns that provide a deeper understanding of the Zomato ecosystem.

## How to Use:
